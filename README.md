# dank memer ripoff
I modified **OLD** Dank Memers publicly available src-code, lol (and made it even worse lmaooo)

**CURRENCY ONLY COMMANDS**

### how 2 install/run

don't, lol

- have nodejs v12 or higher
- go to discord.com and create an app (also click on *add a bot*)
- copy token, put it in src/data/config.json -> "token":"ur-bots-token"
- put yer servers id in the "support" field (we're still in config.json)
- now go back a few folders back and run `npm i`
- google how to install mongodb for yer os
- create a mongodb user, you can use a custom username + pass, don't forget to change it in config.json tho
- finally... do `node .`

### why did I do this

ask Nicoo#06666
also blame corona

btw... add me on discord **maxi#7777**
