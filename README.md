# dank memer ripoff
I modified **OLD** Dank Memers publicly available src-code, lol (and made it even worse lmaooo)

**CURRENCY ONLY COMMANDS**

### how 2 install/run

don't, lol

- have nodejs v12 or higher
- go to discord.com and create an app (also make sure to *add a bot*)
- copy the bots token, put it in src/data/config.json -> "token":"ur-bots-token"
- put yer servers id in the "support" field (we're still in config.json btw)
- now.. go back to the first directory/folder (where memer.js is at) and run `npm i`
- while you wait, go google "how to install mongodb" for yer os
- create a mongodb user, you can use a custom username + pass, don't forget to change it in config.json tho
- and finally... do `node .`

### oh no, an error occured whilst installing

- I told ya not to install (go to https://top.gg/bot/memes and use the real bot)

### why did I do this

ask Nicoo#0666

btw... add me on discord **maxi#7777** if yer lonely
